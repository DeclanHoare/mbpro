MBPRO is a browser extension that adds shortcuts and new features to
ManageBac.

## Features

### CAS Manager

* The divided hour counts have been moved from the tooltip to the face
of the category badge so you can see them at a glance
* A new tab has been added underneath the list showing your progress in
the three categories and overall, out of the targets of 50 hours per
category and 150 hours total
* You can click the total number of hours on any non-completed
experience to quickly edit hours in a small pop-up without leaving the
page
  * The use of this editor is logged with an optional message so that
you can easily see whether or not you have already added hours for a
certain event
* A link to add a reflection has been added next to the displayed
number of reflections
